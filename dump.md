Dr Ross Greene made a song and a dance about how everything is a skills game in ‚Äúplan B parenting‚Äù.
His argument was so profound that someone repeated the above talk almost word for word on a TED stage.

Brene brown did a bunch of fantastic work on several interpersonal domains, example above being about trust.
She‚Äôs got a really good talk that was condensed to a 3 minute short about empathy. I used it to create a foundation with my kids.

And, for anyone freaking out about the nihilism of that statement, I'm working on cybernetics to try help, so it's not all doom and gloom, but it may get worse before I can make it better. Hang in there though, when you feel like depressed clumsy little kittens, many of us are working on it as hard as we can, and if you wanna help, then consider a future in the field of trying to help those like me figure this out for all of us üíô

Edit: This is neuroscience and I wrote this on no sleep. I left a LOT of info and nuance out. It's not just lower dopamine but a more complex bunch of steps laid out in more info here by smarter scientists than my still learning self. This isn't a limiter. It doesn't mean you can't be happy or athletic- just that it'll take more defined structures for rewards pathways tailored to your stimulation needs or more complex mechanics to practice a motor skill. It'll take you longer and the point about bad feedback is it WILL block you early only to learn, hey, I CAN do these things I just need more time and practice! But we're not all the same nor is ADHD fully understood by anyone, so I'm trying merely to pass on the data as I've been taught it in my studies, not speak as an official PhD in the field. Hence, comment, not AMA.

Someday I will. But only once I have enough expertise to answer with full confidence. I'll try add sources more but I just woke up to this and ajsjfjcifjs i need to go find food before neuroanatomy research!

Edit: I still ahven't had breakfast and am adding citations as quick as I can for y'alls info, so I'll just add reply comments here: 1 - 2
